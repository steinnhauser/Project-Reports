Comparison of mandelbrot_1.py, mandelbrot_2.py and mandelbrot_3.py:

All files had the following input parameters:
xmin, xmax = -1.7, 0.6
ymin, ymax = -1.5, 1.5
Nx, Ny = 1000, 1000
escape_time = 200

Time it took to execute:
Python only: 14.66s
Numpy only : 4.44s
Numba (Git): 1.37s

Numba was 10.7x faster than python, and
Numba was 3.24x faster than numpy

All programs seemingly produce the same results.
Numba's Jit is excellent for these calculations.
