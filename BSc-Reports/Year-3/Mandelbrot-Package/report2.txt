Comparison of mandelbrot_1.py and mandelbrot_2.py:

Both files had the following input parameters:
xmin, xmax = -1.7, 0.6
ymin, ymax = -1.5, 1.5
Nx, Ny = 1000, 1000
escape_time = 200

Time it took to execute:
Python only: 14.66s
Numpy only : 4.44s

Numpy was 3.3x faster than python only.

Both methods produced excellent results
despite the calculation time difference.
